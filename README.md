### About pygame
Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write multimedia software, such as games, in Python. Pygame requires the Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can also make use of several other popular libraries.

### Installation of Pygame
Pygame requires Python; if you don't already have it, you can download it from https://www.python.org/ .  
Use python 3.7.7 or greater, because it is much friendlier to newbies, and additionally runs faster.  

The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions.  
We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

### Windows
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`  
### Mac
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`
### Anaconda Mac
Use  
`pythonw`  
Instead of  
`python`

To see if it works, run one of the included examples:  
`py -m pygame.examples.aliens`
