About pygame
Pygame is a cross-platfrom library designed to make it easy to write multimedia software, such as games, in Python. Pygame requires the Python language and SDL multimedia library. It can also make use of several other popular libraries.

Installation
You should definitely begin by installing a binary package for your system. The binary packages usually come with or give the information needed for dependencies. Choose an appropriate installer for your system and version of python from the pygame downloads page. http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Installing from source is fairly automated. The most work will involve compiling and installing all the pygame dependencies. Once that is done run the "setup.py" script which will attempt to auto-configure, build, and install pygame.

Much more information about installing and compiling is available in the install.html file.

Help
If you are just getting started with pygame, you should be able to get started fairly quickly. Pygame comes with many tutorials and introductions. There is also full reference documentation for the entire library. Browse the documentation from the documenantation index. docs/index.html.

On the pygame website, there is also an online copy of this documentation. You should know that the online documentation stays up to date with the development version of pygame in svn. This may be a bit newer than the version of pygame you are using.

Best of all the examples directory has many playable small programs which can get started playing with the code right away.
